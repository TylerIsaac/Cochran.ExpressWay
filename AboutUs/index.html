        This is not some tech company startup looking to learn the auto business
        on the fly. Shop with full confidence knowing that #1 Cochran ExpressWay
        is the online buying arm of #1 Cochran Automotive, a regional,
        family-owned business that has been selling cars for nearly 60 years. We
        are currently the largest automotive retailer in Western Pennsylvania,
        and also serve customers in West Virginia, Ohio, Maryland and New York.

        <br />

        Much has changed with the business since Bob Cochran bought a single
        point Pontiac dealership back in 1965. Bob's son Rob is the visionary
        behind much of this transformation. After joining the company in 1987,
        Rob Cochran became President and CEO five years later. His innovative
        ideas, insight and instinct spurred decades of growth, making #1 Cochran
        one of the largest privately-owned auto groups in North America today.
        <br />
        <br />

        Rob is also widely known for leading the industry to be more transparent
        in pricing and enhancing the car buying experience for all customers.
        This includes you, as you experience the best of online car buying

        Some online customers may feel they live too far away for it to be
        practical to visit our brick and mortar locations offering service,
        collision repair and customization. Others may be close enough to take
        advantage of our vast expertise in these areas, or just find it worth a
        little bit of a drive.

              routine maintenance, like oil changes, can be performed at any #1
              Cochran location throughout the region.
